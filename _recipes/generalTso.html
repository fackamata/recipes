ingredients:
  - 2 tbsp. cooking oil
  - 3 cloves garlic
  - 45 slices ginger
  - 2 stalks Green Onions Cut Into 1/2 Inch Pieces.
  - 1/2 tsp. sesame seeds
cuisine: Chinoise
sauce:
  - 3/4 cup chicken broth
  - 1 tbsp. light soy sauce
  - 1 tsp. dark soy sauce
  - 1/2 tbsp. oyster sauce
  - 1/4 cup sugar
  - 1½ tbsp. white vinegar
  - 1 tbsp. Shaoxing cooking wine
  - 1 tbsp. potato starch
  - 3 dried red chilies
marinade:
  - 1 Fillet chicken breast
  - 1/2 tsp. salt
  - 1/4 tsp. white pepper
  - 1/2 tbsp. Shaoxing cooking wine
  - 2 Large egg white
  - 1/2 tsp. baking powder
  - 1/2 cup corn starch
  - 1/4 cup flour
  - 2 tbsp. water
  - 1 tbsp. cooking oil

instructions:
  - Cut the chicken breast into long strips and then into 1½-inch cubes.
  - Season the chicken with salt, white pepper, Shaoxing wine, egg whites, baking powder, cornstarch, flour, cold water, and cooking oil. Add oil as needed; don’t pour all at once. The chicken must be evenly covered with egg white. Avoid the egg yolk as it will prevent the outside from crisping and darkening.
  - Mix chicken pieces and let marinate for 10–15 minutes.
  - In another bowl, add chicken broth, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, white vinegar, Shaoxing wine, and starch. Stir well. Cut the dried chilies into small sections; remove and discard seeds. Use only enough chili shells for fragrance, not spice.
  - In a frying pan, add oil. When the oil temperature reaches 300°F/150°C, put the chicken into the pan piece by piece; fry over medium-low heat for 2–3 minutes or until chicken floats to the surface.
  - After the chicken floats to the surface, take it out and cut off the uneven batter for a more appealing appearance.
  - When the oil temperature rises back to 300°F/150°C again, put the chicken in and again and re-fry about 30 seconds. Quickly strain it out of the oil and place it on a paper towel to absorb the excess. It is best to use medium-low heat when frying. The chicken must also be re-fried, otherwise, the texture will not be good.
  - Add oil to a 12-inch pan. Add garlic slices, ginger slices, and spring onions; stir-fry it.
  - Pour the sauce into the pot, keep stirring the mixture as it thickens.
  - Pour in the fried chicken pieces so the sauce completely covers the chicken.
  - Serve the chicken on a plate with sesame seeds to garnish (optional).
  - Enjoy!"
